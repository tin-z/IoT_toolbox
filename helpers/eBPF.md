### 0. Kernel Pwning with eBPF: a Love Story
 - [here](./ebpf_nutshell)



### 1. eBPF-guide ###

 - The Linux kernel contains the eBPF runtime required to run eBPF programs. 
 - It implements the bpf(2) system call for interacting with programs, maps, BTF and various attachment points where eBPF programs can be executed from. 
 - The kernel contains a eBPF verifier in order to check programs for safety and a JIT compiler to translate programs to native machine code. 
 - User space tooling such as bpftool and libbpf are also maintained as part of the upstream kernel

 - [what-is-ebpf](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/)

 - eBPF programs are event-driven and are run when the kernel or an application passes a certain hook point. 
 - Pre-defined hooks include 
    * system calls
    * function entry/exit
    * kernel tracepoints
    * network events
    * and several others.

 - Programming in eBPF directly is incredibly hard, the same as coding in v8 bytecode.

 - ...


### 2. Usability stuff ###

 - bcc and libbpf, and etc. requires a lot of libraries and other constraints (e.g. kernel compiled with CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y flag


### 3. Write eBPF program in C ###
